### Summary of Findings

* Utilization for all buildings for the most recent semester was 94%, while overall utilization from Spring 2018 to Spring 2023 was 87%.
* Taylor Hall had the highest utilization at 95%, while Hamilton Case Library had the lowest overall at 71%.
* All buildings had a significant dip in classroom utilization during the 2020 academic year, except for Berekeley Hall.
* No classes have been held in Otis Hall since the Spring 2022 semester.

### Recommendations
There currently doesn't seem to be an issue with building utilization, most of the low rates were due to the pandemic. 
Turner Arts Center had a slightly low utlization rate the most recent semester, but it is also the building with the least total classrooms, so not a major issue.
